1. Download nrfConnect app on android or iOS.
2. Flash all Ruuvitags so they are on the same firmware: https://lab.ruuvi.com/dfu/
	In my application I use firmware "ruuvi_firmware_dfu_1.2.12.zip"
3. Modify your ConNXT portal and create new RuuviTags 
	Go to the Devices menu, press Create and choose RuuviTag from the drop down.
	Use the same naming scheme as for the existing RuuviTags.
4. On Raspberry Pi, modify the following files
	A. /home/pi/azure-iot-samples-python-master/iot-hub/Quickstarts/simulated-device-2/ruuvi_to_connxt.py
		- Modify the array "tags" to have the Ruuvitag MAC address and tag name
	B. Create 'SendRTXDeviceStatus.py' file (X: Ruuvi tag number from 1 to 12)  in the following directory /home/pi/azure-iot-samples-python-master/iot-hub/Quickstarts/simulated-device-2/
		- Find the Appliance ID in the message sent and modify it according to the tag name ex: if the tag name is 7, then file name will be 'SendRT7DeviceStatus.py' and ApplianceID will be 'CLRT007'
	C. /etc/crontab
		- This is the scheduler for the OS.
		- Modify the line where you call the SendRTXDeviceStatus.py to include the newly created files.
